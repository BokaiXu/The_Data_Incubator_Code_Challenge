# The Data Incubator Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for **The Data Incubator Challenge**. The challenge is designed to evaluate problem-solving skills, proficiency in data analysis, and ability to extract insights from data through advanced analytical techniques. This project showcases my approach to solving a real-world data problem.

## Objectives

- Analyze and process the provided dataset to extract meaningful insights.
- Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to address the challenge objectives.
- Visualize data to communicate findings effectively.
- Demonstrate coding proficiency and clear documentation.
- 
## Dataset

- **Source**: Steam API
- **Description**: Buila a video game recommend system based on Steam

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Exploration**
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, missing values, and feature relationships.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Addressed missing values, handled outliers, and transformed features for analysis.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created additional features to improve model performance or analytical insights.

### 4. **Modeling and Analysis**
   - Applied statistical tests and machine learning models to solve the challenge.
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, F1-score).

### 5. **Visualization**
   - Created plots and charts to communicate insights and findings clearly.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data analysis and modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `NumPy`: Data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive coding and documentation.
